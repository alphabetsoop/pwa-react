# MyPart :recycle: 
Submission for Google Developer Solution Challenge 2021. 
## About 
Last year, the UN reported that electronic waste grew by nearly 40%, but only 1 in 5 electronics are actually being recycled. Introducing MyPart, the web application targeted to help bring awareness to the importance of recycling. 
 
MyPart is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) dedicated to helping people find recycling centers quickly, complete challenges in a gamified system, and earn awards saved in their personal accounts. It's powered by several Google technologies. The frontend uses Google Maps API, Progressive Web App technology, React.js; the backend uses Firebase Authentication, Firestore, Web Hosting, Google Compute Engine, and Next.js for server-side rendering. 
 
Our app is deployed on Firebase, which you can find [here :link:](https://inner-domain-309321.web.app/index.html). Steps to run our app are listed below. 
## Running it locally 
We use Next.js, a wrapper around React.js. Install the latest version of Node, then 
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/alphabetsoop/pwa-react.git 
cd pwa-react 
npm install 
npm run dev # should run on port 3000 
``` 
## Running it for production (deployment) 
It's simple to deploy our app. Build using Next.js and run it! 
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/alphabetsoop/pwa-react.git 
cd pwa-react 
npm run build 
npm run start 
```
